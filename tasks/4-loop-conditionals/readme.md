### 1
Make a function named `checkBoolean` that takes one argument `checkMe` and returns `'YEAH!'` if checkMe is true and `'No :<'` when it's false

### 2 
make for loop which will console.log "My index is `index` and my value is `elements value`". Use numbers array.

### 3 
Make loop which console.logs only fruits from fruits array. Think about how to do it :)
